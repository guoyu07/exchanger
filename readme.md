## About

The application is a fairly straightforward currency converter. It takes a reference rate from a European Central Bank by parsing its [public XML](http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-daily.xml) and provides a feature to exchange any currency including EUR, USD and GBP in any combination.

When app starts there is a limited balance with 100 units of each currency.
